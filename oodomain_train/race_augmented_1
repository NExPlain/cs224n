How do such crowding problems move up, and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which jams appear - road traffic flow. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for dealings flow. One of the first attempts to model dealings flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid gets denser. At first the flow rate increases as the tightness increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same full stop of time. But if the density becomes too high, there ' s a risk of jams, and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber ' s model of a marathon uses this same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to an sudden switch from free to crowd flow. He assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow pace of runners, knowing the \" carrying capacity \" at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to figure out how blocking might depend on the race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by allow all the runners set off at once (which means those at the back have to wait until those in front have moved forward ). Others assign runners to various groups according to ability, and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half - marathon in central Germany, which draw in around 6, 000 participants. The traditional route had to be exchange in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that moon curser could cross safely. It could pass either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the probable blocking caused in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would take a chance an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of jams at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The run organizers confabulate Treiber ' s team, and eventually chose this option.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the worst thing while running a marathon?", "id": "8b792276618d420d9deb16ba0ddd1e72", "answers": [{"answer_start": -1132, "text": "dangerous blocking"}]}]}]}, {"title": "FORBES CHINA's annual celebrity list is based on i", "paragraphs": [{"context": "FORBES CHINA ' s annual celebrity list is based on income and appearing in magazines, newspapers, TV shows and online.

He ' s made a career out of building fantastic card houses, stadiums, capitols, castles - - and the world ' s tallest card tower. How does he do it? Bryan ' s structures are amazing because they are made entirely of absolutely balanced, freestanding playacting placard. Helium never uses mucilage, tape, or anything else to hold the cards together. Nor does he fold the cards. He ' s discovered another way to make a strong house of cards, using a trick from nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells that have tough walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps leaves and stems keep their shape. Bees use the like kind of repeating pattern to create strong honeycombs, where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids, using cards to create a repeating pattern of cells. He begins with a single cell made by balancing four cards against one another to form a box. Then he repeats the cell over and over, expanding outward to form the grid, which makes a good foundation for a strong card structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it can carry. Sometimes Bryan uses several cards, instead of just one, to construct the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells kids when he speaks in classrooms, is to place your cards as tightly together as possible when laying out your grid, making sure the cards are not leaning at all. After building this solid base, Bryan lays cards across the top to make the floor for the next \" story \" of the building. He may add towers, columns, steeples, or domes. Using the principle of repeating cells, Bryan builds social system of amazing strength. In the Cards Not surprisingly, Bryan has always personify interested in building things. Growing up on a \" big, old farm \" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \" We were in the middle of nowhere, \" Bryan remembers, \" with lots of space to do whatever we wanted. I was always making something, using things like sticks or bales of hay. \" Bryan ' s grandfather taught him how to stack cards. Bryan ' s two interest - - building and card stacking - - soon aggregate. But stacking in his family ' s farmhouse be challenging. \" Our previous house had wood floors that weren ' t all level, \" he reports. \" And they weren ' t very firm. When people walked around, it was like ' earthquake action. ' It was a challenge to build something that wouldn ' t fall down immediately. \" Bryan constructed tower after tower; he went through a lot of trial and error before he built anything taller than himself. When he placed a few deck of cards on top of his grid, he attain how unassailable it was. Bryan ' s towers began to grow taller. How Tall Is Too Tall? Bryan ' s first Guinness World Record for the world ' s tallest card tower came in the spring of 1992, when he was in high school. Learning that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches, Bryan built a slim tower that topped out at 14 feet 6 inches. Done as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. Since then he ' s gone on to win world records for even taller buildings. His latest winner measured 25 feet 3. 5 inches and used about 2, 400 decks of cards. _ Why don ' t these towers fall down? The key is in a good solid base, a ingeminate design of stories, and a tapering top. Bryan likes to point knocked out how card buildings resemble real ones. They are built cell by cellphone, story by story. The separate parts make one strong whole. The heavier the building, the hard and more stable it is. But the weight can ' t all be at the top.

Because we can ' t see what we can ' t see, our lecturer was determined to catch us in the act. He had us watch a video of six people tossing basketballs back and forth, three in white shirts and 3 in black, and our task was to keep track only of the tosses among the the great unwashed in white. The tape rolled, and everyone began counting. Everyone except me. I ' m dyslexic, and the moment I saw that tapeline with the confusing basketball tossers, I knew I wouldn ' t be able to keep track of their movements, so I let my mind wander. I became curious, though, when about 30 seconds into the tape, a gorilla walked in among the players. She (we later learned a female student was in the gorilla gorilla suit) stared at the camera, beat her chest with her fist, and then went away while they continued pass the balls. When the tape stopped, the professor asked how many people had counted at least a dozen basketball tosses. Hands went up all over. He then asked who had counted 13, 14, and congratulated those who ' d scored the perfect 15. Then he asked, \" And world health organization saw the gorilla? \" I raised my hand and was surprised to discover I was the only person at my table and one of only three operating room four in the large room to do so.

By concentrating so hard on counting, we had managed to miss the gorilla in the midst. Attention blindness is the fundamental organizing principle of the brain, and I believe that it presents us with a great opportunity. My take is unlike from that of many neuroscientists: Where they see the shortcomings of the individual, I sense an opportunity for cooperation. Fortunately, given the interactive nature of most of our lives in the digital age, we take in the tools to control our dissimilar forms of attention and take advantage of them.

If half the energy that goes into violent acts were put to good use, if our efforts were directed at cleaning up the shabby houses at improving living - standards and providing education and employment for all, we would have gone a long way to arrive at a solution. Our military posture is weakened by having to mop up the mess that violence leave in its wake. In a well - directed cause, it would not be impossible to fulfill the ideals of a stable social programme. The benefits that can be derive from constructive solutions are everywhere apparent in the world around us. Genuine and lasting solutions are always possible, providing we work within the model of the jurisprudence. Before we can even begin to reflect on peaceable co - existence between the races, we must appreciate each other ' s problems. And to do this, we must learn about them: it is a simple exercise in communication, in exchanging information. \" Talk, talk, talk, \" the advocates of violence say, \" all you ever do is talk, and we are none the wiser. \" It ' s rather like the story of the famous lawyer who carefully explained his case to the judge. After listening to a lengthy argument the judge complained that after all this talk, he was none the wiser. \" Possible, my lord, \" the lawyer replied, \" none the wiser, but surely far better informed. \" Knowledge is the necessary prerequisite to wisdom: the knowledge that violence creates the evils it pretends to solve.", "qas": [{"question": "Recorded history has taught us", "id": "3372b6a3133549f4af5df9b725757e8e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 476, "text": "nothing."}]}, {"question": "According the author the best way to solve race prejudice is", "id": "b65b933a7b15401790b44f243f3e3e96", "answers": [{"answer_start": 879, "text": "law enforcement"}]}]}]}, {"title": "In many cultures white is often associated with so", "paragraphs": [{"context": "In many cultures white is often associated with something positive. A white - collar job, for instance, is the kind of job many people bet for, working with your mental capacity and not your hands. White has a clean and pure image. That is why doctors, dentists, and nurse usually wear lily white uniforms. Babies are dressed in white at baptisms and saint bridget wear white wedding gowns at weddings. White in these cases be the symbolization of innocence or purity. Sometimes white is used in expressions that are non good. \" Whitewash \" is one such expression. At first, \" whitewash \" meant to paint over something with white paint to make it look better. Still, information technology means something different today: to hide or to cover up mistakes or failure. A \" white elephant \" personify another representative of white used in a damaging way. In ancient Thailand, a white elephant was regarded as a sacred animal, but it was very expensive to keep. The kings of those day confront a white elephant to the people they wanted to ruin. Once they received this holy, royal animal as a natural endowment, they were not allowed to sell or vote out information technology. Today, a \" white elephant \" means something that is big, useless, and undesirable. In America, when people want to get rid of their furniture or clothes, they often give birth a \" white elephant sale \".", "qas": [{"question": "Which expression has an historical background?", "id": "cc7e1bf548c242af8937d7c2b6851563", "answers": [{"answer_start": 275, "text": "white elephantinformation technologyfailure"}]}]}]}, {"title": "If a business wants to sell its products internati", "paragraphs": [{"context": "If a occupation wants to sell its products internationally, it had better suffice some mart research foremost. This is a lesson that some large American corporations have learned the hard way. What ' s in the figure? Sometimes the job is the name. When General Motors introduced its Chevy Nova into Latin America, information technology overlooked the fact that Nova in Spanish means \" It doesn ' t go \". Sure plenty, the Chevy Nova never went anywhere in Latin America. Translation problems Sometimes it is the slogan that doesn ' t work. No company sleep with this better than Pepsi cola - Cola, with its \" Come awake with Pepsi! \" effort. The effort was so successful in the United States, Pepsi translated its slogan literally for its international campaign. As it turned out, the translations weren ' t quite right. Pepsi was solicit German to \" Come out of the grave \" and telling the Chinese that \" Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave. \" A picture ' s worth a thousand words Other times, the problem involves packaging. A picture of a smiling baby has helped sell countless jars of Gerber baby food. When Gerber started selling baby solid food in Africa, they used the same packaging as in the US, with the smiling baby on the label. Later they learned that in African countries, the picture on the jar shows what the jar has in it, for many people there tail end ' t read. Twist of fate Even the culture and religious factors and pure coincidence can be involved. Thorn McAn shoes have a Thorn McAn \" signature \" inside.

How do such crowding problems arise, and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which jams appear - road traffic flow. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the dealings as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid gets denser. At first the flow rate increases as the density increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there ' s a risk of jams, and the menses charge per unit drops sharply. Treiber ' s model of a marathon utilise this same rule that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the compactness of runners increases, thanks to an sudden substitution from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runner, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can estimate the flow rate of runners, knowing the \" carrying capacity \" at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to figure out how blocking might depend on the race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some battle of marathon start by letting all the runners set off at once (which means those at the back have to wait until those in front have moved forward ). Others assign runners to various groups according to ability, and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half - marathon in central Germany, which attracts around half a dozen, 000 participants. The traditional route had to be change in 2013, because the police were no longer uncoerced to close a road to ensure that runners could cross safely. Information technology could pass either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blocking caused in the various options. The model auspicate that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the commence point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there exist nevertheless a risk of jams at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The run organizers consulted Treiber ' s team, and eventually chose this option.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the worst thing while running a marathon?", "id": "8b792276618d420d9deb16ba0ddd1e72", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3278, "text": "dangerous blockingexistnevertheless"}]}]}]}, {"title": "FORBES CHINA's annual celebrity list is based on i", "paragraphs": [{"context": "FORBES communist china ' s annual celebrity list is based on income and appearances in magazines, paper, TV shows and online.

He ' mho made a career out of build fantastic card houses, stadiums, capitols, castles - - and the world ' s tallest card tower. How does he do it? Bryan ' s structures are amazing because they are made entirely of perfectly balanced, freestanding playing cards. He never uses glue, tape, or anything else to hold the cards together. Nor does he fold the cards. He ' s discovered another way to make a strong house of cards, use a trick from nature. To make plants strong, nature builds them with cells that have tough walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps leaves and stems keep their shape. Bees use the same kind of repeating pattern to create strong honeycombs, where they live and store honey. William jennings bryan designs similar grids, using cards to create a repeating pattern of cells. He begins with a single cell take a crap by balancing four cards against one another to form a box. Then he repeats the cell over and over, expanding outward to form the grid, which makes a good foundation for a strong card structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it can carry. Sometimes Bryan uses several cards, instead of just one, to construct the cell walls, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells kids when he speaks in classrooms, is to place your cards as tightly together as possible when laying out your gridiron, making sure the cards are not leaning at all. After building this solid base, Boy orator of the platte lays cards across the top to make the floor for the next \" story \" of the building. He may add towers, columns, steeples, surgery domes. Using the principle of repeating cells, Bryan build structures of amazing strength. In the Cards Not surprisingly, Bryan has always been concerned in building things. Growing up on a \" big, old farm \" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \" We be in the middle of nowhere, \" Bryan remembers, \" with lots of space to do whatever we wanted. I was always making something, using things like sticks or bales of hay. \" Bryan ' s grandfather taught him how to stack cards. William jennings bryan ' s two interests - - building and card stacking - - soon combined. But stacking in his family ' s farmhouse was challenging. \" Our old house had wood floors that weren ' t all level, \" helium reports. \" And they weren ' t very firm. When people walked around, it was like ' earthquake action. ' It was a challenge to progress something that wouldn ' t fall down immediately. \" Bryan constructed tower after tower; he went through a lot of trial and error before he built anything taller than himself. When he set a few decks of cards on top of his grid, he discovered how strong it was. Bryan ' s towers began to grow taller. How Tall Is Too Tall? Bryan ' s first Guinness World Record for the world ' s tall card tower came in the spring of 1992, when he was in high school. Learning that the world record was 12 feet 10 inches, Bryan built a slim tower that topped out at 14 feet 6 inches. Done as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. Since then he ' s gone on to win world records for even taller buildings. His latest winner measured 25 feet 3. 5 inches and used about 2, 400 decks of cards. _ Why don ' t these towers fall down? The key is in a good solid base, a repeating pattern of stories, and a tapering top. Bryan likes to point out how card buildings resemble real ones. They are built cell by jail cell, story by story. The separate parts make one strong whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and more stable it is. But the weight can ' t all be at the top.

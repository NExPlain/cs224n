It gets harder and harder to drill deep into the earth because rocks get subdued and softer. Hard but well broken at the surface, rocks become plastic at astuteness, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlaying crust - - - about 52, 800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible.

So maybe it ' s time for a thorough new method acting to explore the earth ' s inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack. Stevenson suggests digging a crack about a half mile long, a yard wide, and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Next, he ' d pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack, along with a robot.

How do such crowding problems spring up, and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which jams appear - road traffic flow. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flow rate. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid baffle denser. At first the flow rate increases as the density increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there ' s a risk of jams, and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber ' s model of a marathon apply this same principle that the stream rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to an sudden switch from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runner, knowing the \" carrying capacity \" at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to figure out how blocking might depend on the race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by letting all the runners set off at once (which means those at the back have to wait until those in front have moved forward ). Others assign runners to various groups according to ability, and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the poser to the annual Rennsteig half - marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6, 000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runner could cross safely. It could pass either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blocking caused in the various options. The simulation predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the bit assumed in the model cost only when slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of jams at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The run organizers consulted Treiber ' s team, and eventually chose this option.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the worst thing while running a marathon?", "id": "8b792276618d420d9deb16ba0ddd1e72", "answers": [{"answer_start": -1553, "text": "dangerous blocking"}]}]}]}, {"title": "FORBES CHINA's annual celebrity list is based on i", "paragraphs": [{"context": "FORBES CHINA ' s annual renown list is based on income and appearance in magazines, newspapers, TV shows and online.

Sounds unbelievable, doesn't it?", "paragraphs": [{"context": "A house of cards? Sounds unbelievable, doesn ' t it? Not if the architect is 31 - year - old Bryan Berg. He ' s made a career out of progress fantastic card house, stadiums, capitols, castles - - and the world ' s tallest card tower. How does he do it? Bryan ' s structures are amazing because they are made entirely of perfectly balanced, freestanding playing cards. He never apply gum, tape, or anything else to hold the cards together. Nor does he fold the cards. He ' s discovered another way to make a strong house of cards, using a conjuring trick from nature. To make plants firm, nature builds them with cells that have tough walls. Rows and rows of these cells form a grid that helps leaf and stems keep their shape. Bees use the same kind of repeating pattern to create strong honeycombs, where they live and store honey. Bryan designs similar grids, use cards to create a repeating pattern of cells. He begins with a single cell made by balance four cards against one another to form a box. Then he repeats the cell over and over, expanding outward to form the grid, which makes a good fundament for a strong card structure. The larger the grid, the more weight it can carry. Sometimes Bryan uses several cards, instead of just one, to construct the cell wall, making the grid even stronger. The trick, he tells kids when he speaks in classrooms, is to place your cards as tightly together as possible when laying out your grid, make certain the cards are not leaning at all. After building this solid base, Bryan lays cards across the top to make the floor for the next \" story \" of the building. He may add towers, columns, steeples, or domes. Using the principle of repeating cells, Bryan builds structures of amazing strength. In the Cards Not surprisingly, Bryan has always been interested in building things. Growing up on a \" big, old farm \" in rural Iowa, he had plenty of room to play. \" We were in the middle of nowhere, \" Bryan remembers, \" with lots of space to do whatever we wanted. I be always making something, using things like sticks or bales of hay. \" Bryan ' s grandfather taught him how to stack cards. Bryan ' s two interests - - building and card stacking - - soon combined. But stacking in his family ' s farmhouse was challenging. \" Our old house had wood floors that weren ' t all level, \" he reports. \" And they weren ' t very firm. When citizenry walked around, it was like ' earthquake action. ' It embody a challenge to build something that wouldn ' t fall down immediately. \" Bryan constructed tower after tower; he went through a lot of trial and error before he built anything taller than himself. When he placed a few decks of cards on top of his grid, he discovered how strong it was. Bryan ' second towers began to grow taller. How Tall Is Too Tall? Bryan ' s first Guinness World Record for the world ' s tallest card tower came in the spring of 1992, when he was in high school. Learning that the world record was 12 feet 10 inch, Bryan built a slim tower that topped out at 14 feet 6 inches. Done as a project for his geometry class, it took him 40 hours and 208 decks of cards. Since then he ' s gone on to win world records for even taller buildings. His latest winner measured 25 feet 3. 5 inches and used about 2, 400 deck of cards. _ Why don ' t these towers fall down? The key is in a good solid base, a repeating pattern of stories, and a tapering top. Bryan likes to point out how card buildings resemble real ones. They are built cell by cell, story by story. The separate parts make one strong whole. The heavier the building, the stronger and to a greater extent stable it is. But the weight can ' t all be at the top.

If half the energy that goes into violent acts were put to in effect habit, if our exertion were directed at cleaning up the shabby houses at improving living - standards and providing educational activity and employment for all, we would have gone a long way to arriving at a solution. Our strength is weakened by having to mop up the mess that violence leaves in information technology wake. In a well - directed cause, it would not be impossible to fulfill the ideals of a stable social programme. The benefits that can be derived from constructive solutions are everywhere evident in the world around us. Genuine and lasting solutions are always possible, providing we work within the framework of the natural law. Before we can even begin to reflect on peaceful co - existence between the races, we must appreciate each other ' s problems. And to do this, we must learn about them: it is a simple exercise in communication, in exchanging information. \" Talk, talking, talk, \" the advocates of violence say, \" all you ever do is talk, and we are none the wiser. \" It ' s rather like the story of the famous lawyer world health organization carefully explained his case to the judge. After listening to a lengthy argument the judge complained that after all this talk, he was none the wiser. \" Possible, my lord, \" the lawyer replied, \" none the wiser, but surely far better informed. \" Knowledge is the necessary prerequisite to wisdom: the knowledge that violence creates the evils it pretends to solve.", "qas": [{"question": "Recorded history has taught us", "id": "3372b6a3133549f4af5df9b725757e8e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 295, "text": "nothing."}]}, {"question": "According the author the best way to solve race prejudice is", "id": "b65b933a7b15401790b44f243f3e3e96", "answers": [{"answer_start": -1046, "text": "law enforcement"}]}]}]}, {"title": "In many cultures white is often associated with so", "paragraphs": [{"context": "In many culture white make up a great deal associated with something positively charged. A white - collar job, for instance, represent the form of job many the great unwashed look for, working with your brain and not your hands. E. b. white has a clean and pure image. That is why dr., dentists, and nurses usually wear white uniforms. Babies are dressed in white at baptisms and brides wear off white wedding party gowns at weddings. White in these cases is the symbol of innocence or purity. Sometimes white is used in formula that are non good. \" Whitewash \" is one such expression. At first, \" whitewash \" meant to paint over something with white paint to make it look better. However, it means something unlike today: to hide or to cover up mistakes or failures. A \" white elephant \" is another example of white hot used in a negative way. In ancient Thailand, a snowy elephant was involve as a sacred animal, but it was very expensive to keep. The kings of those days presented a white elephant to the people they wanted to ruin. Once they received this holy, royal animal as a giving, they were non allowed to sell or kill it. Today, a \" white hot elephant \" means something that is big, useless, and unwanted.

Sure enough, the Chevy Nova never went anywhere in Latin America. Translation job Sometimes information technology is the slogan that doesn ' t work. No company knows this better than Pepsi cola - Colon, with its \" Come alive with Pepsi! \" campaign. The campaign was so successful in the United States, Pepsi cola translated its slogan literally for information technology international campaign. As it turned out, the rendering weren ' t quite right. Pepsi cola was begging Germans to \" Come out of the grave \" and telling the Chinese that \" Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave. \" A picture ' s deserving a thousand words Other times, the trouble involves promotional material. A picture of a smile baby has helped sell unnumberable jars of Gerber baby food. When Gerber started selling baby food in Africa, they used the same packaging as in the US, with the smiling baby on the label. Later they learned that in African countries, the picture on the jar show what the jar has in it, for many people there can ' t read.
